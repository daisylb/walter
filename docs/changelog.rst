Upgrade guide
=============

In future releases of Walter, this page will describe the steps you'll need to take to upgrade existing code that uses Walter to new versions.

How Walter is versioned
-----------------------

Walter is versioned with **major.minor** version numbers. The distinction is this: versions that require an entry in the upgrade guide get a new major version number; versions that do not increment the minor version number.

The latest version is the only supported version.
